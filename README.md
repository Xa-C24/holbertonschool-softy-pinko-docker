# Docker Project

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of Docker for creating, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Docker ensures that applications run reliably regardless of the environment.

---

## Features

- Use of **Docker Images** to package the application.
- Creation of **Docker Containers** to run isolated instances.
- Use of **Dockerfile** for reproducible builds.
- Implementation of **Volumes** for persistent data storage.
- Exposing application **ports** for external access.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose (if required)
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t <image_name> .
```

### Step 3: Run the Container

Run a container from the image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name <container_name> <image_name>
```

### Step 4: Access the Application

Once the container is running, access the application via your web browser at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## File Structure

```
/
├── Dockerfile           # Instructions to build the Docker image
├── app/                 # Application code
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies for the application
└── README.md            # Documentation
```

## Useful Commands

### Image Management

- List all images:
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- Remove an image:
  ```bash
  docker rmi <image_id>
  ```

### Container Management

- List running containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- Stop a container:
  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```
- Remove a container:
  ```bash
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

### Cleanup

Remove all unused data:

```bash
docker system prune
```

## Dockerfile Example

Here is the `Dockerfile` used for this project:

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Python image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port for the application
EXPOSE 80

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
